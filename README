An implementation of Map-Reduce framework in c++.

This framework recieves a client as defined in the file Client.h, with the predefined functions 'map' and 'reduce'. It then proccess the given data and places it in an output vector.

(K1, V1), (K2, v2), (k3, v3) are the key-value expected types by the client for each of the phases (mapping, sorting and reducing)

Multithreading is maintained throughout the whole process.

To initialize the process, call the function 'startMapReduceJob'
in the file MapReduceFranework.cpp with a valid Client that follows the pattern
of Client.h
